/*
question #2: Arrays allow you to store a collection of data in one variable/ reference point which eliminates the need
to use multiple individual variables to store each data piece. this is especially important when you have a large number
of data for a specific purpose.

question #3: objects and classes are important because it helps break up your program into simpler pieces and creates
modularity. it allows you to do things in chunks and reduces the need to rewrite certain arithmetic and processes.
it also gives the benefit of only needing to change one piece of code instead of multiple which can lead to errors.
